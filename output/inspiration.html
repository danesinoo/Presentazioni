<h1>Presentazioni</h1>
<p>A small program to create attractive presentations starting from a markdown. 
I believe I need it because I have the impression that it will be necessary 
during my career and life to create different presentations. So I need 
something that allows me to create a nice presentation from a template quickly 
and easily.</p>
<p>Presentations are managed in markdown. In fact, the inspiration for this 
program comes from Obsidian's slides. On the other hand, I noticed that one of 
my professors used very simple and nice slides, which moved using the same Vim 
keybindings. It seems to me that the program used by my professor to manage web 
pages was written in Java. I haven't investigated much about the latter, I 
just got inspired by the graphical interface. The idea is to combine these two 
things (it seems to me that Obsidian slides also have Vim keybindings, but 
that's not the only thing I took from my teacher's slides).</p>
