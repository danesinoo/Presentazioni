<h1>Slide navigation:</h1>
<p>Navigation can occur via the vertical bars or via Vim motions (h, j, k, l).</p>
</section>
<div><h2>How does it work?</h2>
<ul>
<li>.md into .hmtl</li>
<li>headers (#, ##, ...) into slides</li>
</ul>
<section class="comment"/>
<h2>General operation:</h2>
<p>The program takes as input a folder containing Markdown files and transforms 
them into HTML pages. Each Markdown section of the header type (indicated by #, 
##, ####, etc.) becomes a slide in the resulting HTML page. The content under 
each header constitutes the content of the slide.</p>
<h2>Program Startup:</h2>
<p>The program starts by executing its executable followed by two flags:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-s path/to/source/directory</code> specifies the input folder.</li>
<li>o <code>path/to/output/directory</code> specifies the output folder.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tip:</h2>
<p>It is advisable to copy the &quot;assets&quot; folder containing the necessary CSS and 
JavaScript files to make the HTML pages dynamic as described above.</p>
</section>
</div>
<div><h2>Slides structure</h2>
<ul>
<li>title</li>
<li>content</li>
</ul>
<section class="comment"/>
<h2>Slide Structure:</h2>
<p>Each slide has a predefined space for the title and one for the content.
The content is resized using CSS scale to fit the dedicated space.
Slides are indicated by thin vertical bars at the edges of the HTML page, which 
appear or disappear depending on the presence of slides in the indicated 
directions.</p>

<div><h2>Comments</h2>
<section class="comment"/>
<h2>Content/Comments Window:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pressing <code>c</code> toggles the content/comments window.</li>
<li>This section can contain detailed information, references, or additional 
explanations.</li>
<li>Comments start with <code>---</code> and end with <code>---</code>.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</div>
<div><h2>Import</h2>
<ul>
<li>you can even import some file</li>
<li>I advice to use this to split the presentation and the comments</li>
<li><code>\import[[path/to/import/file.md]]</code></li>
</ul>
<section class="comment"/>
<h2>File Import:</h2>
<p>Using the command <code>\import[[path/to/import/file.md]]</code>, the text 
<code>path/to/import/file.md</code> is replaced with the content of the file at the 
specified path (relative to the input folder).</p>

<h1>Presentazioni</h1>
<p>A small program to create attractive presentations starting from a markdown. 
I believe I need it because I have the impression that it will be necessary 
during my career and life to create different presentations. So I need 
something that allows me to create a nice presentation from a template quickly 
and easily.</p>
<p>Presentations are managed in markdown. In fact, the inspiration for this 
program comes from Obsidian's slides. On the other hand, I noticed that one of 
my professors used very simple and nice slides, which moved using the same Vim 
keybindings. It seems to me that the program used by my professor to manage web 
pages was written in Java. I haven't investigated much about the latter, I 
just got inspired by the graphical interface. The idea is to combine these two 
things (it seems to me that Obsidian slides also have Vim keybindings, but 
that's not the only thing I took from my teacher's slides).</p>
